title: IM HERE – Interaction Model for Human Effort based Robot Engagement
description: We present our novel engagement modeling framework IMHERE, designed to improve human-robot interaction by capturing relational dynamics using a formal effort-based approach. The model applies to human-human, human-robot, and robot-robot interaction, and offers a modular implementation supporting real-world robotics integration.

## IM HERE – Interaction Model for Human Effort based Robot Engagement

Engagement is a central requirement for natural and adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI), yet it remains difficult to generalize across settings. Our recent publication introduces **\IMHERE**, a formal and generalizable interaction model built on the idea that **engagement can be modeled through observable and interpretable effort between entities**.

The model captures bilateral relationships between any two entities—whether human, robot, or object—by tracking their **focus**, the allocation of cognitive or perceptual resources, and interpreting their emitted **effort**. Each interaction is reduced to one of four fundamental states: `Passive`, `Requested`, `Buildup`, and `Engaged`.

Unlike traditional models, \IMHERE bridges **subjective and objective perspectives**, includes mechanisms to identify **miscommunication**, and introduces principles for **social norm-compliant interaction**. The model applies equally to **individual** and **group interactions**, integrating concepts like **F-formations** and enabling social robots to reason about their role in dynamic, multi-party environments.

To support adoption, we provide an **open-source simulator** that enables testing and visualizing engagement in a variety of HRI scenarios.
