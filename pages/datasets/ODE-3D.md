## Object Detection Environment 3D (ODE-3D)
The ODE-3D dataset was created and analyzed as part of a Master’s thesis conducted within the framework of the DFG project SEMIC. The thesis was authored by Christian Becker under the supervision of Magnus Jung, and evaluated by Prof. A. Al-Hamadi and Dr. G. Krell. The dataset is currently in the publication process.

## Abstract
In cooperative environments, human-machine interaction can simplify human
work and make it more efficient. For easy accessibility and greater acceptance,
this interaction must be intuitive. The machine must be able to recognize and
understand the human communication signals. This information can be used to
identify focused objects in the environment. This work investigates the attention-
based detection of target objects based on the modalities of gaze direction, head
pose, and pointing gesture. For this purpose, a new dataset is designed and
recorded to provide a reference for target object detection. The Object Detec-
tion Environment 3D (ODE-3D) dataset provides image data from a realistic
human-machine interaction and contains all relevant information about the posi-
tion of objects in a three-dimensional space. By fusing the modalities using
machine learning methods, target object detection is implemented based on the
recorded dataset. An implementation in a real-time application demonstrates the
potential use in a cooperative human-machine environment.
