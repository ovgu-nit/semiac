## Implicit mobile human-robot communication for spatial action coordination with action-specific semantic environment modelling

With the increasing use of robots in industrial and everyday contexts, the need for systems that can interact flexibly and cooperatively with humans is growing. Collaborative robots (cobots) in particular, which share a common workspace with humans and can react to complex, dynamic environments, are coming into focus. A central challenge here is the context-related perception of the environment and the appropriate interpretation of human behavior.

## Founding
The project SEMIAC - Implicit mobile human-robot communication for spatial action coordination with action-specific semantic environment modelling (Implizite mobile Mensch-Roboter-Kommunikation für die räumliche Handlungskoordination mit aktionsspezifischer semantischer Umgebungsmodellierung) is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) under grant No. 502483052 and is planned with a project duration of 3 years (2023 to 2026).
